# 💡 Updated Concept — *"IdeaCheck"* (working title)
> *"Not sure if your startup idea is worth building? Let’s find out — instantly."*

Instead of generating random ideas, this tool helps validate **your own startup ideas** using a mix of:
- 🧠 Smart AI analysis
- 🧮 Startup scoring models
- 🔍 Trend + market comparison
- 👥 Optional crowd/community feedback

Think of it as your personal **startup decision assistant**, giving honest, structured, and useful input before you commit your time and code.

---

## 🧠 What It Does:
- You enter your startup idea + answer a few structured prompts:
  - What problem are you solving?
  - Who's your target user?
  - How would you make money?
  - What's your unfair advantage?
- AI analyzes your input and responds with:
  - Strengths & red flags
  - Similar startups (and what happened to them)
  - Idea viability score (custom rubric)
  - Suggested MVP scope
  - Validation questions you should ask real users

---

## 🎯 Use Cases:
- Indie hackers deciding which idea to pursue
- First-time founders
- Hackathon teams choosing direction
- Accelerators helping early-stage applicants
- Product teams at big companies testing internal pitches

---

## 💰 Monetization Options:
- Free basic report per idea
- Paid deep dive (e.g. market data, monetization models)
- Pro version: unlimited ideas, MVP planners, investor-style one-pagers
- SaaS for incubators/accelerators/universities
- Optional: Startup Idea Marketplace

## 🔥 MVP Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core Idea Evaluator
- Input fields for idea name + core components
- GPT-powered scoring and feedback report

### Phase 2: Account System + Save History
- Log in / register
- View past ideas, feedback, and scores

### Phase 3: Build Plan Generator
- For each validated idea, generate:
  - MVP feature set
  - Tech stack recommendation
  - Monetization playbook

### Phase 4: Crowd Feedback Layer (Optional)
- Anonymously share ideas for feedback
- Upvote/downvote and comment system

---

## ✨ Future Modes
- **Investor View**: Generate a fake YC-style one-pager or pitch deck
- **Market Watcher**: Alerts you if a similar idea recently got funded
- **Team Up Mode**: Find collaborators based on idea type & skills

---

## 🚀 Why This Wins
- You’re not telling people what to build — you’re helping them decide *if* they should build it
- It saves time, stress, and regret
- You’re serving builders, not dreamers — that’s a power user base
